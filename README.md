# Graph Explorer
Proof-of-concept for loading [Sinopia](https://sinopia.io) RDF by selecting
groups or individual resources. You can then run SPARQL queries againest the
loaded RDF graph.

Through [Pyscript](https://pyscript.net/), the [rdflib](https://rdflib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) Python package is used for loading RDF through Sinopia.
